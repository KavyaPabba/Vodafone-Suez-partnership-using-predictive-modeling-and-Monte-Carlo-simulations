Vodafone × SUEZ Strategic Partnership – Capstone Project

 Overview

This repository contains the work for our Master in Data Science Capstone Project at Rome Business School.
The project evaluates the Vodafone × SUEZ partnership as a model for sustainable Telco–Energy collaborations, focusing on IoT-enabled smart water management.

Our objectives:
	•	Assess business and sustainability benefits of telco–energy partnerships.
	•	Benchmark Vodafone–SUEZ against similar alliances (Orange–Birdz, TIM–Enel X, Deutsche Telekom–Shell).
	•	Build predictive models to forecast adoption, savings, and ROI.
	•	Deliver a business strategy proposal for JOIN Group investment decisions.

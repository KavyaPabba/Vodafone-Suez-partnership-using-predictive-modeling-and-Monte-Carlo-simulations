# Vodafone-Suez-partnership-using-predictive-modeling-and-Monte-Carlo-simulations
Analyzed the Vodafone–SUEZ alliance as a model for telco–utility collaborations in sustainable infrastructure. Applied predictive modeling, KPI benchmarking, and Monte Carlo simulations to forecast adoption, steady-state savings, and ROI. Delivered a strategic framework and roadmap for JOIN Group, aligning financial performance with ESG impact.
# Vodafone–SUEZ Strategic Partnership Analysis

This repository contains the **capstone project** for the Master in Data Science, conducted in collaboration with **JOIN Group**.  
The project evaluates the **Vodafone–SUEZ IoT-enabled smart water partnership** as a benchmark for sustainable telecom–utility collaborations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Assessed Vodafone–SUEZ alliance using **predictive modeling, KPI benchmarking, and Monte Carlo simulations**.
- Evaluated **ROI, steady-state savings, adoption forecasts, and ESG impact**.
- Benchmarked against peer partnerships: **Orange–ENGIE, TIM–Enel X, Deutsche Telekom–Shell/Vattenfall**.
- Delivered a **business strategy roadmap** for JOIN Group, aligning profitability with sustainability.

---

## 📊 Key Results
- **Adoption Forecast**: ~2M smart meters by 2030, scaling faster post-2026.
- **Water Savings**: Up to **15% reduction**, ~450B liters saved.
- **Financial ROI**: Payback period ~5–6 years (shorter with EU subsidies).
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Quantified uncertainty in ROI distributions, risk-adjusted performance metrics.
- **ESG Impact**: CO₂ savings equivalent to removing ~300,000 cars/year.
